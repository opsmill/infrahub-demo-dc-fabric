## Running the demo on your pc

### Set environment variables

```shell
export INFRAHUB_ADDRESS="http://localhost:8000"
export INFRAHUB_API_TOKEN="06438eb2-8019-4776-878c-0941b1f1d1ec"
export CEOS_DOCKER_IMAGE="9r2s1098.c1.gra9.container-registry.ovh.net/external/ceos-image:4.29.0.2F"
export LINUX_HOST_DOCKER_IMAGE="9r2s1098.c1.gra9.container-registry.ovh.net/external/alpine-host:v3.1.1"
```

### Install the Infrahub SDK

```shell
poetry install --no-interaction --no-ansi --no-root
```

### Start Infrahub

```shell
poetry run invoke start
```

### Load schema and data into Infrahub

This will create :

- Basics data (Account, organization, ASN, Device Type, and Tags)
- Locations data (Locations, VLANs, and Prefixes)
- Topology data (Topology, Topology Elements)
- Security data (Policies, rules, objects)

```shell
poetry run invoke load-schema load-data
```

## Running the demo in Github Codespaces

[Spin up in Github codespace](https://codespaces.new/opsmill/infrahub-demo-dc-fabric-develop)

## Demo flow

### 1. Add the repository into Infrahub (Replace GITHUB_USER and GITHUB_TOKEN)

> [!NOTE]
> Reference the [Infrahub documentation](https://docs.infrahub.app/guides/repository) for the multiple ways this can be done.

```graphql
mutation AddRepository{
  CoreReadOnlyRepositoryCreate(
    data: {
      name: { value: "infrahub-demo-dc-fabric" }
      location: { value: "https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub-demo-dc-fabric.git" }
    }
  ) {
    ok
    object {
      id
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Generate a Topology (Device, Interfaces, Cabling, BGP Sessions, ...)

> [!NOTE]
> The example below creates the topology fra05-pod1

```shell
poetry run infrahubctl run generators/generate_topology.py topology=fra05-pod1
```

### 3. Generate a network service in a Topology

> [!NOTE]
> The example below creates the Layer2 network service and a another Layer3 on topology fra05-pod1

```shell
poetry run infrahubctl run generators/generate_network-services.py topology=fra05-pod1 type=layer2
poetry run infrahubctl run generators/generate_network-services.py topology=fra05-pod1 type=layer3 vrf=production
```

### 4. Render Artifacts

Artifact Generation is not currently present in the UI but it's possible to try it out locally :

> [!NOTE]
> This command will render the artifact define with `device_arista` Transformation, for `fra05-pod1-leaf1` device

```shell
poetry run infrahubctl render device_arista device=fra05-pod1-leaf1
```

### 5. Try out our pytest plugin

> [!NOTE]
> The command will use our infrahub pytest plugin. It will run the different test in the `tests` folder. Those tests included :
>
> - Syntax checks for all the GraphQL Queries
> - Syntax checks for the Checks
> - Syntax checks for all the jinja files used in `templates`
> - will use the input/output file to try out the rendering and confirm there is no unexpected missing piece

```shell
pytest -v ./tests
```

### 6. Create a new Branch

Create directly a new branch `test` in the UI, or if you prefer to use our SDK in CLI :

```shell
poetry run infrahubctl branch create test
```

### 7. Create new Network Services and Regenerate Artifacts in your branch

> [!NOTE]
> You will be able to see the Diff in the Branch not only about the Data but about the Artifact as well
> You can go back in time to see the Diff on the branch before you create the new services (you can do it `main` after merging the proposed changes too)

### 8. Create a proposed change

Using your new branch `test` you will be able to see the Diff in the Proposed Change and you will see the checks / tests in the CI pipeline

### 9. Try out  the topology check

- Modify an Elements in a Topology (example: increase or decrease the quantity of leaf switches in fra05-pod1)

- The checks will run in the Proposed Changes -> check_device_topology will fail.

### 10. Deploy your environment to containerlabs

The containerlab generator automatically generates a containerlab topology artifact for every topology. Every device has its startup config as an artifact.

```shell
# Download all artifacts automatically to ./generated-configs/
poetry run python3 scripts/get_configs.py

# Start the containerlab
sudo -E containerlab deploy -t ./generated-configs/clab/fra05-pod1.yml --reconfigure
```
