# Infrahub by OpsMill

[Infrahub](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub) by [OpsMill](https://opsmill.com) acts as a central hub to manage the data, templates and playbooks that powers your infrastructure. At its heart, Infrahub is built on 3 fundamental pillars:

- **A Flexible Schema**: A model of the infrastructure and the relation between the objects in the model, that's easily extensible.
- **Version Control**: Natively integrated into the graph database which opens up some new capabilities like branching, diffing, and merging data directly in the database.
- **Unified Storage**: By combining a graph database and git, Infrahub stores data and code needed to manage the infrastructure.
