title: Welcome to the Infrahub DC fabric demo
---

Welcome to the Infrahub data center fabric demonstration repository. This demo showcases how Infrahub serves as a central source of truth for managing modern data center infrastructure running VxLAN/EVPN with integrated security policies. It demonstrates Infrahub's core capabilities—schema-driven data modeling, version control for infrastructure, automated configuration generation, and seamless integration with industry-standard tools like Arista AVD and Containerlab. Whether you're an infrastructure engineer exploring network automation, a developer building on Infrahub, or an architect evaluating infrastructure management platforms, this demo provides hands-on experience with real-world patterns and workflows.

## Documentation guide

This documentation is organized following the [Diataxis framework](https://diataxis.fr/) to help you find exactly what you need:

### Getting started

| Page | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **[Installation guide](./install.mdx)** | Step-by-step instructions to install and set up the demo environment on your system. Start here if this is your first time running the demo. |

### Tutorials

| Page | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **[User walkthrough](./user-walkthrough.mdx)** | A complete hands-on tutorial that guides you through the end-user experience: generating topologies, creating network services, managing branches, reviewing proposed changes, and deploying to Containerlab. Perfect for learning the workflow from start to finish. |

### Guides

| Page | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **[Developer guide](./developer-guide.mdx)** | Technical deep-dive into how the demo works under the hood. Covers schema architecture, bootstrap scripts, generators, transforms, checks, and testing. Use this when extending functionality, troubleshooting issues, or understanding implementation details. |

### Topics

| Page | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **[Understanding the concepts](./concepts.mdx)** | Explains the architectural patterns, design decisions, and core Infrahub concepts demonstrated in this project. Read this to understand the "why" behind topology abstraction, generators, resource pools, and integration patterns. |

## Quick start

If you're ready to dive in:

1. Follow the **[installation guide](./install.mdx)** to set up your environment
2. Walk through the **[user tutorial](./user-walkthrough.mdx)** to create your first network service
3. Explore the **[concepts](./concepts.mdx)** to deepen your understanding
4. Reference the **[developer guide](./developer-guide.mdx)** when you're ready to extend or customize

## What you'll learn

Through this demo, you'll gain practical experience with:

- **Schema-driven infrastructure modeling** - Defining devices, networks, and services with flexible, extensible schemas
- **Version control for data** - Using branches and proposed changes to safely modify infrastructure
- **Automated resource allocation** - Generating IP prefixes, VLANs, and addressing from resource pools
- **Configuration generation** - Transforming structured data into device configurations via templates
- **Data validation** - Enforcing consistency with custom checks
- **Integration workflows** - Connecting Infrahub with Arista AVD and Containerlab for deployment
- **GitOps patterns** - Managing infrastructure as code with full versioning and review workflows

## Architecture at a glance

The demo implements a realistic data center fabric with:

- **Spine-leaf topology** with VxLAN/EVPN overlay
- **Layer 2 and Layer 3 network services** spanning multiple devices
- **Security policies** with firewall rules and address objects
- **Resource pools** for IP address and VLAN allocation
- **Multi-vendor support** (Arista, Cisco, Juniper templates)
- **Automated topology generation** from abstract definitions
- **Containerlab integration** for virtual lab deployment

## Key features demonstrated

### Schema extensibility

The demo includes comprehensive schemas for DCIM, IPAM, topology, routing, and security. These schemas define not just object types, but relationships, constraints, and lifecycle behaviors.

### Generators and automation

When you add a network service to a group, generators automatically create all supporting objects—VLANs, IP prefixes, interface addresses—following best practices and business rules.

### Branch-based workflows

All changes happen in branches. Proposed changes provide diff views, run validation checks, and regenerate artifacts before merging to main.

### Artifact generation

Templates transform Infrahub data into deployable artifacts: device configurations, OpenConfig JSON, Containerlab topologies, and more.
